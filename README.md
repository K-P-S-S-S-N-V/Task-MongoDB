  {'score': 35.8740349954354, 'type': 'homework'}]}
```

## Now Let us Answer to the Questions

# 1) Find the student name who scored maximum scores in all (exam, quiz and homework)?
## student who score highest score in exam
```python
db = client.test
exam=db.exam_collection              #Total no.of Exam documents count 
exam.count_documents({})
```
Output:
```
200
```
```python
exam.drop()

for j in range(200):
  x=records2.aggregate([{"$match":{"_id":j}},{"$unwind":"$scores"},{"$match":{"scores.type":"exam"}},{"$sort":{"scores.score":-1}}])
  for i in x:
    i=exam.insert_many([i])

s=exam.find().sort('scores.score',-1).limit(1) 
for i in s:
  print(i)                              
```
Output:
```
{'_id': 136, 'name': 'Margart Vitello', 'scores': {'score': 99.33685767140612, 'type': 'exam'}}
```
## student who score highest score in quiz
```python
db = client.test
quiz=db.quiz_collection
quiz.count_documents({})                         #Total no.of Quiz documents count 
```
Output:
```
200
```
```python
quiz.drop()

for j in range(200):
  x=records2.aggregate([{"$match":{"_id":j}},{"$unwind":"$scores"},{"$match":{"scores.type":"quiz"}},{"$sort":{"scores.score":-1}}])
  for i in x:
    i=quiz.insert_many([i])

s=quiz.find().sort('scores.score',-1).limit(1)
for i in s:
  print(i)                               
```
Output:
```
{'_id': 69, 'name': 'Cody Strouth', 'scores': {'score': 99.80348240553108, 'type': 'quiz'}}
```
## student who score highest score in homework
```python
db = client.test
homework=db.homework_collection
homework.count_documents({})                     #Total no.of Homwwork documents counts 
```
Output:
```
200
```
```python
homework.drop()

for j in range(200):
  x=records2.aggregate([{"$match":{"_id":j}},{"$unwind":"$scores"},{"$match":{"scores.type":"homework"}},{"$sort":{"scores.score":-1}}])
  for i in x:
    i=homework.insert_many([i])
   
s=homework.find().sort('scores.score',-1).limit(1)
for i in s:
  print(i)                                #student who score highest score in homework
```
Output:
```
{'_id': 178, 'name': 'Whitley Fears', 'scores': {'score': 99.77237745070993, 'type': 'homework'}}
```
so, from here,
we got know about

## max score in exam is 'Margart Vitello'
{'_id': 136, 'name': 'Margart Vitello', 'scores': {'score': 99.33685767140612, 'type': 'exam'}}

## max score in quiz s 'Cody Strouth'
{'_id': 69, 'name': 'Cody Strouth', 'scores': {'score': 99.80348240553108, 'type': 'quiz'}}

## max score in homework is 'Whitley Fears'
{'_id': 178, 'name': 'Whitley Fears', 'scores': {'score': 99.77237745070993, 'type': 'homework'}}


# 2)Find students who scored below average in the exam and pass mark is 40%?

## first we need to find Avg score in Exam
```python

x=db.exam_collection.aggregate([{'$group' : {'_id' : "null", "avg_exam" : {'$avg' : "$scores.score"}}}])
for i in x:
  print(i)
```
Output:
```
{'_id': 'null', 'avg_exam': 48.67367075950175}
```
```python
db = client.test
lessavg=db.lessavg_collection
lessavg.count_documents({})  # total find no.of students with lessavg score  
```
Output:
```
104
```
## To find less than/ below average score in Exam
```python
lessavg.drop()

x=db.exam_collection.find({'scores.score':{'$lt':48.67367075950175} })
for i in x:
  i=lessavg.insert_many([i])
  
lessavg.count_documents({})
```
Output:
```
104
```

# 3) Find students who scored below pass mark and assigned them as fail, and above pass mark as pass in all the categories.

## Students who Fail in EXAM
```python
db = client.test
failexam=db.fail_exam
failexam.count_documents({})
```
Output:
```
81
```
```python
failexam.drop()

x=db.exam_collection.find(
    {'scores.score':{'$lt':40}
     }
)
for i in x:
  i=failexam.insert_many([i])
  #print(i)
  
failexam.count_documents({})
```
Output:
```
81
```
## Students who Pass in EXAM
```python
db = client.test
passexam=db.pass_exam
passexam.count_documents({})
```
Output:
```
119
```
```python
passexam.drop()

x=db.exam_collection.find(
    {'scores.score':{'$gte':40}
     }
)
for i in x:
  i=passexam.insert_many([i])

passexam.count_documents({})
```
Output:
```
119
```
## Students who Fail in Quiz
```python
db = client.test
failquiz=db.fail_quiz
failquiz.count_documents({})
```
Output:
```
86
```
```python
failquiz.drop()

x=db.quiz_collection.find(
    {'scores.score':{'$lt':40}
     }
)
for i in x:
  i=failquiz.insert_many([i])

failquiz.count_documents({})
```
Output:
```
86
```
## Students who Pass in Quiz
```python
db = client.test
passquiz=db.pass_quiz
passquiz.count_documents({})
```
Output:
```
114
```
```python
passquiz.drop()

x=db.quiz_collection.find(
    {'scores.score':{'$gte':40}
     }
)
for i in x:
  i=passquiz.insert_many([i])

passquiz.count_documents({})
```
Output:
```
114
```
## Students who fail in Homework
```python
db = client.test
failhomework=db.fail_homework
failhomework.count_documents({})
```
Output:
```
29
```
```python
failhomework.drop()

x=db.homework_collection.find(
    {'scores.score':{'$lt':40}
     }
)
for i in x:
  i=failhomework.insert_many([i])
  
  
failhomework.count_documents({})
```
Output:

Here, this are the collections that are created

db.gt_pass_exam.......this new collection which consists of students who scored above pass mark in exam
db.gt_pass_quiz.......this new collection which consists of students who scored above pass mark in quiz
db.gt_pass_homework...this new collection which consists of students who scored above pass mark in homework
















The Wasmtime CLI can be installed on Linux and macOS with a small install
script:

```sh
curl https://wasmtime.dev/install.sh -sSf | bash
```

Windows or otherwise interested users can download installers and
binaries directly from the [GitHub
Releases](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases) page.

## Example

If you've got the [Rust compiler
installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) then you can take some Rust
source code:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

and compile/run it with:

```sh
$ rustup target add wasm32-wasi
$ rustc hello.rs --target wasm32-wasi
$ wasmtime hello.wasm
Hello, world!
```

## Features

* **Fast**. Wasmtime is built on the optimizing [Cranelift] code generator to
  quickly generate high-quality machine code either at runtime or
  ahead-of-time. Wasmtime is optimized for efficient instantiation, low-overhead
  calls between the embedder and wasm, and scalability of concurrent instances.

* **[Secure]**. Wasmtime's development is strongly focused on correctness and
  security. Building on top of Rust's runtime safety guarantees, each Wasmtime
  feature goes through careful review and consideration via an [RFC
  process]. Once features are designed and implemented, they undergo 24/7
  fuzzing donated by [Google's OSS Fuzz]. As features stabilize they become part
  of a [release][release policy], and when things go wrong we have a
  well-defined [security policy] in place to quickly mitigate and patch any
  issues. We follow best practices for defense-in-depth and integrate
  protections and mitigations for issues like Spectre. Finally, we're working to
  push the state-of-the-art by collaborating with academic researchers to
  formally verify critical parts of Wasmtime and Cranelift.

* **[Configurable]**. Wasmtime uses sensible defaults, but can also be
  configured to provide more fine-grained control over things like CPU and
  memory consumption. Whether you want to run Wasmtime in a tiny environment or
  on massive servers with many concurrent instances, we've got you covered.

* **[WASI]**. Wasmtime supports a rich set of APIs for interacting with the host
  environment through the [WASI standard](https://wasi.dev).

* **[Standards Compliant]**. Wasmtime passes the [official WebAssembly test
  suite](https://github.com/WebAssembly/testsuite), implements the [official C
  API of wasm](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasm-c-api), and implements
  [future proposals to WebAssembly](https://github.com/WebAssembly/proposals) as
  well. Wasmtime developers are intimately engaged with the WebAssembly
  standards process all along the way too.
